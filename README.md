# RecipeApp
A simple Java Spring Boot web application that uses Webflux and MongoDB to allow a user to create, store, edit, and view recipes. 

# Installation and setup
Download and extract the project and open it in your preferred IDE. 

Download, install, and run a local MongoDB server (This project will eventually be updated to use an embedded server)
